## Instruction how to run project. Made by Filip R.
# Firstly install node.js on your PC. MacOS/Linux/Windows
# Download the project
# Open terminal in the parent directory of the project
# Type 'npm install -g @angular/cli' to install Angular CLI. /// On Windows client computers, the execution of PowerShell scripts is disabled by default. Just type Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned to solve it.
# Type in terminal 'npm install', npm will install all dependecies rquired to run project.
# If npm complete installing all packages with successful result open new terminal in the same directory as before and type 'json-server --watch db.json' to run server.
# Now back to the earlier terminal and type 'ng serve -o'
# Enjoy! I hope it will be good enough.
